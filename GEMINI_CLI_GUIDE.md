### 1. Opening the Terminal

First, you need to open a terminal window in the IDE. You can do this by navigating to the top menu and selecting **Terminal > New Terminal**.

### 2. Running the `gemini` Command

Once the terminal is open, you can launch the Gemini CLI by typing the following command and pressing **Enter**:

```bash

```

### 3. Connecting to Firebase Studio

The first time you run the `gemini` command, you will be prompted to connect to Firebase Studio.

```

```

Select **Yes** to allow Gemini to interact with your project and development environment.

### 4. Authentication

After connecting, you will be prompted to authenticate with your Google account.

```

```

Select **Login with Google**. This will open a new browser tab or window for you to complete the authentication process. Follow the on-screen instructions to sign in to your Google account.
