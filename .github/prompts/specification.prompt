# Project Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the specification for a Flutter application that leverages generative AI to create a travel itinerary. The application will allow users to input their destination, interests, and the number of days for their trip. The AI will then generate a detailed itinerary, which the user can view, save, and share.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. User Input

- The application will provide a user-friendly interface for users to input the following information:
    - Destination (City, Country)
    - Interests (e.g., history, art, food, nature, etc.)
    - Number of days for the trip

### 2.2. Itinerary Generation

- The application will use a generative AI model to create a travel itinerary based on the user's input.
- The generated itinerary will include:
    - A day-by-day schedule of activities.
    - Recommendations for restaurants, attractions, and accommodations.
    - Estimated travel times between locations.
    - A map view of the itinerary.

### 2.3. Itinerary Viewing and Management

- The application will display the generated itinerary in a clear and organized format.
- Users will be able to:
    - View the itinerary on a map.
    - Save the itinerary for later viewing.
    - Share the itinerary with others.

### 2.4. User Authentication

- Users will be able to create an account and log in to save and manage their itineraries.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Performance

- The application will be responsive and performant, with a smooth and intuitive user experience.
- The itinerary generation process will be completed within a reasonable amount of time.

### 3.2. Scalability

- The application will be designed to scale and handle a growing number of users and data.

### 3.3. Security

- The application will be secure, with measures in place to protect user data.

### 3.4. Platform Support

- The application will be available for both iOS and Android devices.

## 4. Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter
- **Backend**: Firebase (for authentication, database, and hosting)
- **Generative AI**: Gemini

## 5. UI/UX Design

- The application will have a clean, modern, and intuitive user interface.
- The UI will be designed to be accessible to users with disabilities.

## 6. Assumptions and Constraints

- The user will have an active internet connection to generate and view itineraries.
- The accuracy of the generated itinerary will depend on the capabilities of the generative AI model.
- The application will be developed and deployed within the specified timeframe and budget.
